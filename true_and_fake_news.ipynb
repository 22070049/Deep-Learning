During his ever-changing, boundary-pushing career, Bowie continuously used his celebrity and visibility to shed light on social issues that were being ignored.As we mourn the loss of Bowie, it s worth taking a moment to recall just one time that the singer called out injustice in the most rock n  roll way imaginable.In 1983, Bowie was shocked to learn that many of his African-American musical peers were being purposely ignored by MTV because  black music  was making white Americans uncomfortable. Never one to let people s discomfort dictate how he behaved, Bowie blasted the music network for its cowardice.Using an interview with MTV as an ironic platform for critiquing the network, Bowie grilled MTV VJ Mark Goodman about the network s shameless whitewashing. The exchange has become a legendary example of Bowie s sheer lack of patience for bullshit.There are many reasons to love David Bowie. Here's one. 1982: challenging MTV on their refusal to play black music: pic.twitter.com/0ku30wccVG  Charlene White (@CharleneWhite) January 11, 2016Like many television networks, MTV had decided to censor black performers so as to not offend the predominately white audience from  middle America.  Unlike the other networks, however, MTV was marketed on the premise of being edgy and revolutionary. Bowie revealed what a sham that image was. Is there anything less rock n  roll than being cowered by white, middle class mom s from Iowa who were afraid to see Prince or Rick James on television?Bowie (along with James, who explicitly called the network racist in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine) had brought up an issue that could no longer be ignored. It also may have saved MTV from itself. Just months after the public backlash, MTV exploded with the release of Michael Jackson s  Billie Jean,  followed by  Thriller.  The music videos would become among the most iconic ever released and, to many, would later come to define what a  music video is.Bowie passed away on January 10, 2016, but it s clear that his music, and his legacy, will live on for much, much longer. To honor him, we should not just listen to the incredible wealth of music he left us, but also never be afraid to stand up to inequality and injustice, wherever we find it.Feature image via Wikipedia\",\n          \"In perhaps the clearest example of the small, but egregious way Donald Trump lies about even the little things, he got caught screwing up less than 2 seconds after announcing that he  doesn t make mistakes. It unfolded like a scene from a comedy, Trump, angry at his plummeting poll numbers and numerous scandals, complained that the press were obsessed with looking for flaws in his White House. Rather than admit he s only human, Trump doubled down on his absurd contention that he s never wrong. One mistake and it s no good. But we just can t make mistakes, right? So we don t make mistakes. Ready for the punchline?Trump next passes the conversation over to  Ken. Go ahead, Ken. That wasn t  Ken.  That s Chuck Canterbury, the head of the National Fraternal Order of Police.Oops.While flatly stating that you never make mistakes is a ridiculous thing to lie about, it only serves to highlight the general level of dishonesty that is rampant in Trump s White House. He s so incapable of admitting he s wrong that Trump goes to great lengths to never apologize for anything he s ever said   no matter how false. Trump never apologized for linking Ted Cruz s dad to the JFK assassination. His  apology  for six years of promoting birtherism turned out to be a  sorry, not sorry  publicity stunt. He can t even admit his unfounded claim that Obama wiretapped his phones was a complete fabrication.But here s the really scary part. A lie as obvious as  I never make mistakes  brings us to an unsettling truism: If a person will lie about the little things, what will he do to cover up the big ones?Featured image via YouTube\",\n          \"This is too good to miss!

During his ever-changing, boundary-pushing career, Bowie continuously used his celebrity and visibility to shed light on social issues that were being ignored.As we mourn the loss of Bowie, it s worth taking a moment to recall just one time that the singer called out injustice in the most rock n  roll way imaginable.In 1983, Bowie was shocked to learn that many of his African-American musical peers were being purposely ignored by MTV because  black music  was making white Americans uncomfortable. Never one to let people s discomfort dictate how he behaved, Bowie blasted the music network for its cowardice.Using an interview with MTV as an ironic platform for critiquing the network, Bowie grilled MTV VJ Mark Goodman about the network s shameless whitewashing. The exchange has become a legendary example of Bowie s sheer lack of patience for bullshit.There are many reasons to love David Bowie. Here's one. 1982: challenging MTV on their refusal to play black music: pic.twitter.com/0ku30wccVG  Charlene White (@CharleneWhite) January 11, 2016Like many television networks, MTV had decided to censor black performers so as to not offend the predominately white audience from  middle America.  Unlike the other networks, however, MTV was marketed on the premise of being edgy and revolutionary. Bowie revealed what a sham that image was. Is there anything less rock n  roll than being cowered by white, middle class mom s from Iowa who were afraid to see Prince or Rick James on television?Bowie (along with James, who explicitly called the network racist in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine) had brought up an issue that could no longer be ignored. It also may have saved MTV from itself. Just months after the public backlash, MTV exploded with the release of Michael Jackson s  Billie Jean,  followed by  Thriller.  The music videos would become among the most iconic ever released and, to many, would later come to define what a  music video is.Bowie passed away on January 10, 2016, but it s clear that his music, and his legacy, will live on for much, much longer. To honor him, we should not just listen to the incredible wealth of music he left us, but also never be afraid to stand up to inequality and injustice, wherever we find it.Feature image via Wikipedia\",\n          \"In perhaps the clearest example of the small, but egregious way Donald Trump lies about even the little things, he got caught screwing up less than 2 seconds after announcing that he  doesn t make mistakes. It unfolded like a scene from a comedy, Trump, angry at his plummeting poll numbers and numerous scandals, complained that the press were obsessed with looking for flaws in his White House. Rather than admit he s only human, Trump doubled down on his absurd contention that he s never wrong. One mistake and it s no good. But we just can t make mistakes, right? So we don t make mistakes. Ready for the punchline?Trump next passes the conversation over to  Ken. Go ahead, Ken. That wasn t  Ken.  That s Chuck Canterbury, the head of the National Fraternal Order of Police.Oops.While flatly stating that you never make mistakes is a ridiculous thing to lie about, it only serves to highlight the general level of dishonesty that is rampant in Trump s White House. He s so incapable of admitting he s wrong that Trump goes to great lengths to never apologize for anything he s ever said   no matter how false. Trump never apologized for linking Ted Cruz s dad to the JFK assassination. His  apology  for six years of promoting birtherism turned out to be a  sorry, not sorry  publicity stunt. He can t even admit his unfounded claim that Obama wiretapped his phones was a complete fabrication.But here s the really scary part. A lie as obvious as  I never make mistakes  brings us to an unsettling truism: If a person will lie about the little things, what will he do to cover up the big ones?Featured image via YouTube\",\n          \"This is too good to miss!
